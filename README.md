1.0 Problem Statement
Ensuring the safety and security of children is a significant concern for parents, particularly in environments where distance monitoring and timely alerts are critical. Conventional solutions like GPS trackers or mobile applications often lack immediate responsiveness or require a network connection, making them less reliable in certain situations.
Our project aims to address this issue by creating a low-cost, Bluetooth-based proximity alarm system. This solution ensures that both parents and children are alerted if the connection between their devices weakens or is lost, indicating an increased distance. By offering a simple and robust alternative, this system provides peace of mind to parents while enhancing IT security for their children.
